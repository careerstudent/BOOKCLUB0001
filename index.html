            This project is inspired by Reading Rainbow, Between the Lions, my public library, and my parents who instilled in me a geniuine love for reading and learning.
    
            I will add styling and functionality to the site as I continue reviewing.

        <h4> Chrysanthemum by Kevin Henks</h4>
        <p>
            “She’s perfect,” said her mother.
“Absolutely,” said her father.
And she was.
She was absolutely perfect.
“Her name must be everything she is,” said her mother.
“Her name must be absolutely perfect,” said her father.
And it was.
Chrysanthemum. Her parents named her Chrysanthemum.
Chrysanthemum grew and grew and grew. And when she was old enough to appreciate
it, Chrysanthemum loved her name. She loved the way it sounded when her mother woke her up.
She loved the way it sounded when her father called her for dinner. And she loved the way it sounded
when she whispered it to herself in the bathroom mirror.
Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum.
Chrysanthemum loved the way her name looked when it was written with ink on an envelope.
She loved the way it looked when it was written with icing on her birthday cake. And she loved the way
it looked when she wrote it herself with her fat orange crayon.
Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum.
Chrysanthemum thought her name was absolutely perfect.
And then she started school.
On the first day, Chrysanthemum wore her sunniest dress and her brightest smile. She ran all the way.
“Hooray!” said Chrysanthemum. “School!”
But when Mrs. Chud took roll call, everyone giggled upon hearing Chrysanthemum’s name.
“It’s so long,” said Jo.
“It scarcely fits on your name tag,” said Rita, pointing.
“I’m named after my grandmother,” said Victoria.
“You’re named after a flower?”
Chrysanthemum wilted.
She did not think her name was absolutely perfect.
She thought it was absolutely dreadful.
The rest of the day was not much better.
During naptime Victoria raised her hand and informed Mrs. Chud that Chrysanthemum’s name was
spelled with thirteen letters.
“That’s exactly half as many letters as there are in the entire alphabet?” Victoria explained.
“Thank you for sharing that with us, Victoria,” said Mrs. Chud. “Now put your head down.
“If I had a name like yours, I’d change it,” Victoria said as the students lined up to go home.
I wish I could, thought Chrysanthemum miserably.
“Welcome home!” said her mother.
“Welcome home!” said her father.
“School is no place for me,” said Chrysanthemum. “My name is too long. It scarcely fits on my name tag.
And I’m named after a flower!”
“Oh, pish,” said her mother. “Your name is beautiful.”
“And precious and priceless and fascinating and winsome,” said her father.
“It’s everything you are,” said her mother.
“Absolutely perfect,” said her father.
Chrysanthemum felt much better after her favorite dinner (macaroni and cheese with ketchup) and an
evening filled with hugs and kisses and Parcheesi.
That night Chrysanthemum dreamed that her name was Jane.
It was an extremely pleasant dream.
The next morning Chrysanthemum wore her most comfortable jumper. She walked to school as slowly
as she could. She dragged her feet in the dirt.
Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum.
“She even looks like a flower,” said Victoria, as Chrysanthemum entered the playground.
“Let’s pick her,” said Rita, pointing.
“Let’s smell her,” said Jo.
Chrysanthemum wilted.
She did not think her name was absolutely perfect. She thought it was absolutely dreadful.
The rest of the day was not much better.
During naptime Victoria raised her hand and said, “A chrysanthemum is a flower. It lives in a garden with
worms and other dirty things.”
“Thank you for sharing that with us, Victoria,” said Mrs. Chud. “Now put your head down.”
“I just cannot believe your name,” Victoria said as the students lined up to go home.
Neither can I, thought Chrysanthemum miserably.
“Welcome home!” said her mother.
“Welcome home!” said her father.
“School is no place for me,” said Chrysanthemum. “They said I even look like a flower. They pretended
to pick me and smell me.”
“Oh, pish,” said her mother. “They’re just jealous.
“And envious and begrudging and discontented and jaundiced,” said her father.
“Who wouldn’t be jealous of a name like yours?” said her mother.
“After all, it’s absolutely perfect,” said her father.
Chrysanthemum felt a trifle better after her favorite dessert (chocolate cake with
buttercream frosting) and another evening filled with hugs and kisses and Parcheesi.
That night Chrysanthemum dreamed that she really was a chrysanthemum.
She sprouted leaves and petals. Victoria picked her and plucked the leaves and petals one by one until
there was nothing left but a scrawny stem.
It was the worst nightmare of Chrysanthemum’s life.
Chrysanthemum wore her outfit with seven pockets the next morning.
She loaded the pockets with her most prized possessions and her good luck charms.
Chrysanthemum took the longest route possible to school.

She stopped and stared at each and every flower.
“Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum,” the flowers seemed to say.
That morning the students were introduced to Mrs. Twinkle, the music teacher.
Her voice was like something out of a dream, as was everything else about her.
The students were speechless.
They thought Mrs. Twinkle was an indescribable wonder.
They went out of their way to make a nice impression.
Mrs. Twinkle led the students in scales. Then she assigned roles for the class musical.
Victoria was chosen as the dainty Fairy Queen. Rita was chosen as the spiffy Butterfly Princess.
Jo was chosen as the all‐important Pixie messenger. And Chrysanthemum was chosen as a daisy.
“Chrysanthemum’s a daisy! Chrysanthemum’s a daisy!” Jo, Rita, and Victoria chanted, thinking it was
wildly funny.
Chrysanthemum wilted.
She did not think her name was absolutely perfect.
She thought it was absolutely dreadful.
“What’s so humorous?” asked Mrs. Twinkle.
“Chrysanthemum!” was the answer.
“Her name is so long,” said Jo.
“It scarcely fits on her name tag,” said Rita, pointing.
“I’m named after my grandmother,” said Victoria.
“She’s named after a flower!”
“My name is long,” said Mrs. Twinkle.
“It is?” said Jo.
“My name would scarcely fit on a name tag,” said Mrs. Twinkle.
“It would?’ said Rita, pointing.

“And‐‐‐“ said Mrs. Twinkle, “I’m named after a flower, too!”
“You are?” said Victoria.
“Yes,” said Mrs. Twinkle. “My name is Delphinium. Delphinium Twinkle. And if my baby is a girl, I’m
considering Chrysanthemum as a name. I think it’s absolutely perfect.”
Chrysanthemum could scarcely believe her ears.
She blushed.
She beamed.
She bloomed.
Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum.
Jo, Rita, and Victoria looked at Chrysanthemum longingly.
“Call me Marigold,” said Jo.
“I’m Carnation,” said Rita, pointing.
“My name is Lily of the Valley,” said Victoria.
Chrysanthemum did not think her name was absolutely perfect. She knew it!
EPILOGUE:
Overall, the class musical was a huge success. Chrysanthemum was absolutely perfect as a
daisy. Victoria made the only mistake: She completely forgot her lines as the dainty Fairy Queen.
Chrysanthemum thought it was wildly funny, and she giggled throughout the entire Dance
of the Flowers. Eventually, Mrs. Twinkle gave birth to a healthy baby girl. And, of course, she named her
Chrysanthemum.

            <h4>The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf</h4>
            <p>Once upon a time in Spain
                there was a little bull and his
                name was Ferdinand.
                All the other little bulls he
                lived with would run and jump
                and butt their heads together,
                but not Ferdinand.
                He liked to sit just quietly and
                smell the flowers.
                He had a favorite spot out in
                the pasture under a cork tree.
                It was his favorite tree and he
                would sit in its shade all day
                and smell the flowers.
                Sometimes his mother, who
                was a cow, would worry about
                him. She was afraid he would
                be lonesome all by himself.
                "Why don't you run and play
                with the other little bulls and
                skip and butt your head?" she
                would say.
                But Ferdinand would shake
                his head. "I like it better here
                where I can sit just quietly and
                smell the flowers."
                His mother saw that he was
                not lonesome, and because
                she was an understanding
                mother, even though she was
                a cow, she let him just sit
                there and be happy.
                As the years went by
                Ferdinand grew and grew until he
                was very big and strong.
                All the other bulls who had
                grown up with him in the same
                pasture would fight each other
                all day. They would butt each
                otehr and stick each other with
                their horns. What they wanted
                most of all was to be picked
                to fight at the bill fights in Madrid.
                But not Ferdinand—he still
                liked to sit just quietly under
                the cork tree and smell the
                flowers.
                One day five men came in very
                funny hats to pick the biggest,
                fastest roughest bull to fight
                in the bull fights in Madrid.
                All the other bulls ran around
                snorting and butting, leaping
                and jumping so the men would
                think that they were very very
                strong and fierce and pick them.
                Ferdinand knew that they
                wouldn't pick him and he
                didn't care. So he wount out
                to his favorite cork tree to
                sit down.
                He didn't look where he was
                sitting and instead of sitting
                on the nice cool grass in the
                shade he sat on a bumble bee.
                Well, if you were a bumble
                bee and a bull sat on you what
                would you do? You would
                sting him. And that is just what
                this bee did to Ferdinand.
                Wow! Did it hurt! Ferdinand
                jumped up with a snort. he
                ran around puffing and snorting,
                butting and pawing the
                ground as if he were crazy.
                The five men saw him and they
                all shouted with joy. here was
                the largest and fiercest bull of
                all. Just the one for the bull
                fights in Madrid!
                So they took him away for the
                bullfight day in a cart.
                What a day it was! Flags were
                flying, bands were playing...
                and all the lovely ladies had
                flowers in their hair.
                They had a parade ino the
                bull ring. First came the Banderilleros
                with long sharp pins with
                ribbins on them to stick in
                the bull and make him mad.
                Next came the Picadores who rode skinny horses and they
                had long spears to stick in the
                bull and make him madder.
                Then came the Matador, the
                proudest of all—he thought he
                was very handsome, and bowed
                to the ladies. He had a red cape
                and a sword and was supposed
                to stick the bull last of all.
                Then came the bull, and you
                know who that was don't you?
                —FERDINAND.
                They called him Ferdinand
                the Fierce and all of the Banderilleros
                were afraid of him and
                the Picadores were afraid of
                him and the Matador was
                scared stiff.
                Ferdinand ran to the middle of
                the ring and everyone shouted
                and clapped because they
                thought he was going to fight
                fiercely and butt and snort
                and stick his horns around.
                But not ferdinand. When he
                got to the middle of the ring
                he saw the flowers in all the
                lovely ladies' hair and he just
                sat down quietly and smelled.
                He wouldn't fight and be fierce
                no matter what they did. He
                just sat and smelled. And the
                Banderilleros were mad and
                the Picadores were madder and
                the Matador was so mad he
                cried because he couldn't show
                off with his cape and sword.
                So they had to take Ferdinand
                home.
                And for all I know he is sitting
                there still, under his favorite
                cork tree, smelling the flowers
                just quietly.
                He is very happy.
